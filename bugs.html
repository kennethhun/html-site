        <p>While our previous startup, Shirts for bugs, was a failure we are confident Shoes for Bugs will succeed!</p>
        <p>Honestly, who would have thought making bug inclusive shirts would be so difficult?</p>

        <h3>The benefits of expanding into the bug market</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bugs have far more legs than most creatures as seen with the humble millipede</li>
            <li>Bugs have large families, massive colonies can supply endless amounts of customers</li>
            <li>Bugs have yet to understand some of the more exploitative methods of capitalism</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Issues to be addressed</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Unforunately, the world has yet to recognize currencies used by insects</li>
            <li>We also acknowledge the potential of pollution, however we believe that insects simply need to learn to recycle</li>
        </ul>

        <p><small>Shoes for Bugs and it's affiliates broadly condemn the colonial bug rights abuses enacted by the various Ant Imperiums</small></p>
