        <h3>The benefits of expanding into the bug market</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bugs have far more legs than most creatures as seen with the humble millipede</li>
            <li>Bugs have large families, massive colonies can supply endless amounts of customers</li>
            <li>Bugs have yet to understand some of the more exploitative methods of capitalism</li>
